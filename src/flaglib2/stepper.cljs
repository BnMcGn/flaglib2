;;;

;; Data format for stepper:

;; A vector of maps.
;; each map describes a step

;; Fields in the step:
;; :id - name of the step, probably a keyword
;; :page - hiccup description of the step, when active
;; :buttons - optional navigation buttons to be placed at bottom of step
;; :label - summary depiction of step when completed. Can be a string or hiccup.
;; :every - an event to fire whenever the step is activated
;; :once - an event that gets run on first load of the step
;; :next, :previous - optional id of where the Next/Previous buttons should jump when activated.
